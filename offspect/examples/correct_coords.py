Each hotspot is a list of x, y, z coordinates.

    .. admonition:: Rationale
    
        For each hemisphere, we did usually perform a fast estimation of the hotspot. This hotspot was used as seed coordinate for a mapping. But it is not known whether the grid was centered on the hotspot, or in case it was, whether the mapping had to be aborted. Therefore, it can not be know for sure just by looking at all coordinates from a mapping, where the origin was. It is therefore necessary for the user to set the hotspot.
